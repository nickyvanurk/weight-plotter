Because I always seem to forget everyone's birthday, I thought it would be nice to write a neat little script to keep track of them.

## Requirements
* Python 3

## Usage
* Allow the script to be executed: `chmod +x birthday_tracker.py`
* Add a birthday: `./birthday_tracker.py -n [name] -b [birthdate]`
* Remove a birthday: `./birthday_tracker.py -r [name]`
* View all birthdays: `./birthday_tracker.py`
